Premise of project: 
=====================
After optimizing $30M in Search Engine Marketing accounts I recognized success patterns.
I soon developed an algorithm with a hedge fund. Our first test account return 29.7% increase in profit margins.
This prototype is a visualization of the special calculations done on top of the Adwords data.

Visualization 1 - Account managers spend 80% of their time stitching together reports just to get a rough overview of the 'paid search' landscape.
This tool provides a full account of the best and worst performing keywords across as many as 100,000 keywords.

Visualization 2 - Identifying the best performing ads in the shallow end of the funnel is easy. Identifying which ads are 
the drivers of profit is most of the time the opposite of what managers might think(based on CTR's and Conversions). This 
visualization combines deep financial data with the sentiment analysis of the ads, finding the bread winners.

Visualization 3 - Google has a black box algorithm that determines your Quality Score foe each key word. This visualization 
clearly represents the proportion of your keywords that are returning negative ROI due to a poor matching of landing page to keyword.
You'll notice a sharp contrast between low quality score and cost per click.
